# Codestra service API contract: Prometheus

This repository owns the **metrics-slo-alert-evaluation-authority** for the Codestra observability, analytics, telemetry, and secrets suite.

## Communication rule

Prometheus keeps its native API and protocol. The shared Codestra control plane in `appolon1908-hue/Codestra-Telemetry` performs only sanitized health, readiness, contract, topology, and immutable-release read-back. It never proxies native query bodies, ingestion, alert delivery, dashboard mutations, secret values, or credential issuance.

Canonical hostname: `prom.codestra.media`  
Native exposure: `internal_private`  
Deployment class: `central`  
Contract: `codestra/api/service-contract.v1.json`

## Native operations

| Method | Path | Category | Access | Control-plane rule |

| `GET` | `/-/ready` | readiness | read_only | never proxied by the Codestra control API |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | metrics | read_only | never proxied by the Codestra control API |

## Suite integrations

| Peer | Direction | Signal | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `alertmanager` | outbound | `alerts` | `http` | send evaluated alerts |
| `grafana` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-http-api` | serve metrics and SLO queries |
| `opentelemetry` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape normalized application metrics |
| `node-exporter` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape host metrics |
| `cadvisor` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape container metrics |
| `redis-exporter` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape Redis metrics |
| `postgres-exporter` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape PostgreSQL metrics |
| `blackbox-exporter` | inbound | `metrics` | `prometheus-scrape` | scrape synthetic probe evidence |

## Identity and correlation

Every private request should propagate `X-Correlation-ID` and W3C `traceparent` when the native protocol supports them. `request_id`, `trace_id`, and `tenant_id` remain structured, protected, non-indexed fields. Metrics use only the bounded dimensions `codestra_business`, `application`, `service`, `environment`, `server`, `region`, and `deployment`.

Business identity is deployment-controlled. Caller-supplied business identity, cross-business defaults, anonymous management access, insecure TLS verification, and inline credentials are prohibited.

## Release and runtime boundary

The control plane reads source revision and image digest only from deployment environment variables. A valid release requires a 40-character Git SHA and `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` image digest. This source change does not deploy the service, activate ingestion/scrapes/probes/alerts, issue credentials, or enable any business, communications, financial, or trading mutation.
