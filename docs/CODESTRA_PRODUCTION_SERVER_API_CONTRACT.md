# Codestra Prometheus Production Server and Native API Contract

## Authority

- Repository: `appolon1908-hue/Codestra-Prometheus`
- Role: corporate metrics, recording-rule, SLI/SLO, and alert-evaluation authority
- Canonical hostname: `prom.codestra.media`
- Central production host: `37.27.128.39`
- Core host `65.109.65.169`: approved scrape/remote-metric source only
- Status: `SOURCE_CONTRACT_PREPARED_NOT_DEPLOYED`

This repository owns Prometheus configuration, rules, target policy, native API access, image/release evidence, retention/recovery, and rollback. It does not own alert delivery, application telemetry collection, business mutation, or provider actions.

## Native API surface

| Method | Path | Purpose | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/-/ready` | readiness | private/read-only |
| `GET` | `/-/healthy` | process health | private/read-only |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | Prometheus self-metrics | private |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/query` | bounded instant query | authenticated operator/read-only |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/query_range` | bounded range query | authenticated operator/read-only |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/rules` | rule state | authenticated/read-only |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/alerts` | alert-evaluation state | authenticated/read-only |

Administrative lifecycle, reload, delete-series, snapshot, and other mutation-capable endpoints must not be publicly exposed. Expected protected responses may be `401`, `403`, `405`, `422`, or `429`; unexpected `404` and `5xx` are blockers.

## Target and label policy

- Native ports stay private on `37.27.128.39`.
- Targets are allowlisted and source-controlled.
- `codestra_business`, `application`, `service`, `environment`, `server`, `region`, and `deployment` are the canonical dimensions.
- Customer, tenant, user, request, trace, message, order, payment, transaction, URL, container-ID, and pod-UID values are prohibited metric labels.
- Scrape credentials come from approved runtime secret files/OpenBao, never Git.
- Down, stale, duplicate, high-cardinality, or source-drifted targets block certification.

Prove Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Redis Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, and approved OpenTelemetry metrics flow into Prometheus, then into Grafana. Alert delivery remains governed outside this repository.

## Repository-first remediation

A runtime defect must be fixed here with a regression test, committed, pushed, reviewed, merged, rebuilt, signed, and added to the production BOM before retrying the server wave. Do not patch Prometheus directly on the host and leave GitHub behind.

## Safety

This document does not deploy Prometheus or activate scrapes. SSH changes, business writes, communications delivery, provider mutation, lending, payments, and trading remain outside scope and disabled.
