# Codestra Prometheus authority

This directory is the authoritative source for Codestra metrics collection, target discovery, recording rules, and alert evaluation. Service repositories own metric exposure; this repository owns scraping, labels, aggregation, alerts, and the canonical service catalogue. Alertmanager owns routing and notification credentials. Grafana must query recording rules instead of repeatedly evaluating expensive raw PromQL.

## Safety and labels

Metrics stay on the private `codestra-observability` network. Prometheus binds to loopback for reverse-proxy access; exporters and application endpoints are never published to the internet. Every target carries `environment`, `server`, `application`, `service`, and `tenant_scope`. Central metrics use `tenant_scope=aggregate`; raw tenant, customer, account, user, email, phone, token, session, request, trace, message, order, workflow, webhook, idempotency, raw path, URL, and query labels are rejected or stripped.

## Backend contract

Backends expose normalized `codestra_http_requests_total`, `codestra_http_request_duration_seconds`, dependency/database latency histograms, queue depth, worker failures, outbox/inbox count and oldest age, webhook delivery/retry counters, authentication/authorization failures, idempotency conflicts, reconciliation failures, provider failures, `codestra_deployment_info`, and `codestra_capability_state`. Capability modes are `disabled`, `simulation`, `shadow`, or `enabled`; live external-effect capabilities require `approval_state=approved` and production evidence.

## Activation

Targets marked `activation=pending` are excluded from the active workload job. The
controlled Middleware target is scraped only by its OAuth2-authenticated readiness
job so Prometheus connectivity can be proven before activation. Flip a target to
`active` only after its service-owned PR, private-network attachment, endpoint
contract test, and cardinality review pass. MoneyBee remains excluded under the
owner's standing no-change directive.

Promotion is `feature/* -> development -> test -> staging -> production -> main`. Merging does not deploy or enable live application behavior.

The dedicated staging runtime authority is
`codestra/deploy/compose.staging.yaml`. It deploys only Prometheus, publishes no
host port, preserves the Docker default seccomp profile, and joins exactly the
shared observability network plus the isolated Middleware staging network. The
Middleware target remains `activation=pending` until the approved read-only
identity and runtime endpoint have both been independently proven. Activation
requires the collector's sanitized evidence document, its exact SHA-256 in the
activation contract, and a reviewed three-file transition containing only the
target, contract, and newly added evidence document. Subsequent active-state CI
validates the evidence without replaying that one-time transition.

The collector binds its base URL to the exact configured Prometheus target,
requires actual samples for every mandatory metric family, performs two
authenticated scrapes at least 300 seconds apart, and accepts a sanitized
Prometheus-only rollback proof from an absolute non-writable file. The committed
evidence contains hashes and allowlisted results only; bearer tokens remain in
mode-`0600` files outside Git and are never printed.
Because monitoring JWTs live for no more than 300 seconds, the token issuer must
atomically renew both token files during the soak. The collector rereads both
files after the delay and rejects unchanged credentials before the second scrape
or runtime-safety readback.

While the target label is `pending`, the dedicated
`middleware-intake-staging-readiness` scrape job exercises the same OAuth2
client-secret exchange, private network, limits, and metric relabeling as the
active job. Activation evidence must query the deployed Prometheus target API
and `up` series and prove that this exact readiness target is UP with a
successful HTTP 200 scrape. Evidence requests explicitly ignore inherited proxy
settings so bearer tokens cannot leave the private network boundary.

Rendering or deployment must use
`codestra/scripts/deploy_staging_runtime.py`. Deployment mode rejects a dirty
checkout, a non-SHA label, a SHA other than the checked-out head, and a head not
merged into protected `origin/main`; it then recreates only the Prometheus service.
The deployment waits up to 120 seconds for the source-defined Prometheus
healthcheck and reports PASS only after the container is healthy.

## Immutable runtime preflight

The Compose candidate no longer accepts one free-form image string. Each image is assembled as:

```text
IMAGE_REPOSITORY@sha256:IMAGE_DIGEST
```

Repository inputs must contain no tag or digest. Digest inputs must be exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. Every render, release packet, and deployment procedure must run the preflight against the exact environment file before invoking Compose:

```bash
python codestra/scripts/validate_runtime_images.py --env-file /run/codestra/prometheus.env
docker compose --env-file /run/codestra/prometheus.env -f codestra/compose.yaml config
```

A direct `docker compose up` that bypasses this preflight is not an approved Codestra deployment path. CI negative-tests mutable tags, embedded digests, uppercase hashes, short hashes, and non-digest values.

## Validation and rollout

```bash
python codestra/scripts/validate.py
python codestra/scripts/validate_runtime_images.py --env-file /run/codestra/prometheus.env
cd upstream && go build -o ../.bin/promtool ./cmd/promtool
../.bin/promtool check config ../codestra/prometheus/prometheus.yml
../.bin/promtool check rules ../codestra/prometheus/rules/*.yml
```

Deploy exporters first, then built-in service metrics, then application instrumentation. Verify all required targets, send a synthetic Alertmanager alert, remove it, and complete a 24-hour staging soak before production promotion. Never delete backlog rows or enable live delivery to clear an alert.
